# Data-Wrangling-DataScience
This repository contains my second Udacity data analysis project, focusing on real-world data wrangling. I investigated two datasets: one detailing data science salaries and another featuring job postings in the field. The project involved data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to uncover trends in the data science job market.
